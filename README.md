# java_online_quiz_with_leaderboard
A desktop quiz application built using Object-Oriented Programming in Java. Users register/login (with SHA-256 password hashing), take a 10-question MCQ quiz, and view a live leaderboard of top 10 scores. The system uses Java Swing for a clean, responsive GUI and MySQL to store users and scores persistently.
